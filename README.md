## Model Description  

### Architecture:  
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts input tokens into dense vectors.  
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures temporal dependencies in sequential data.  
- **Dense Layer**: Outputs the predicted word probabilities.

## Data Preparation  

1. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Remove punctuation and convert text to lowercase.  
   - Split text into sequences of fixed length.  

2. **Tokenization**:  
   - Convert words to integer tokens using the Keras Tokenizer.  
   - Pad sequences to ensure consistent input size.  

3. **Embedding**:  
   - Initialize an embedding layer to learn dense word representations.

## Training the Model  

1. **Hyperparameters**:  
   - Epochs: 10-20  
   - Batch size: 32  
   - LSTM units: 128  

2. **Loss Function**:  
   - Categorical Crossentropy.  

3. **Optimizer**:  
   - Adam.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - Perplexity or Accuracy.
